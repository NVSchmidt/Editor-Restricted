# Editor-Restricted
ArcGIS Web Appbuilder editor widget with limitations on which users can access the tool in a given application.

If anyone plans on implementing this, go into the setting/Setting.js file and update the line below the TODO with your Portal URL. Applications built with this need to be housed on another web server accessible to your users, and a link to the application hosted on that server needs to be created as an item in your Portal.
